# Design Patterns (Head First)

### Design Principle

#### Strategy Pattern

* Identify the aspect of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
* Program to an **interface**, not an **implementation**
* Favor **composition** over **inheritance**

#### Observer Pattern

* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
